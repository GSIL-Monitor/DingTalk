      <li><strong>(I) Share</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will not share your Personal Information with companies, organizations or individuals other than DingTalk
      Service Providers, except in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1. <u>Sharing with explicit consent</u>: We will share your Personal Information with other parties with your
        explicit consent;</li>

        believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or
        defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person;</li>
      <li>3. <u>The products and services you request may only be provided with disclosure of your information</u>. For
        example, for using Ding function and conference call service, your cellphone number confirmed with security code
        will be transmitted to basic telecommunication service operators for realization of communication, this
        information will then be displayed to other users as the number of incoming call;</li>
      <li>4. <u>When a complaint is made by others against you.</u> If you infringe upon intellectual property rights or
        other lawful interests, we need to disclose your information as necessary to the complainer for settlement of
        complaint;</li>
      <li>5. <u>In order for you and your friends to find each other in your address book</u>. After you enable
        &ldquo;matching the address book&rdquo; function, the system will match the corresponding attribute code after
        processing the cellphone numbers in your address book with strong encryption algorithm and display matching users
        to you. DingTalk will not retain any identifiable information in your address book. The data of cellphone numbers
        in your address book used in this process will be processed with strong encryption algorithm and the match will
        be conducted through processed attribute code.</li>
      <li>6. <u>Sharing with our Affiliates</u>: <strong>In order to a) facilitate joint service from an account
          connected with different DingTalk services, b) recommend customized information that you may be interested in,
          or (c) protect personal information of the Affiliates of DingTalk, other users or the public, your Personal
          Information may be shared with our Affiliates.</strong> We will only share necessary Personal Information (for

        we will share your necessary account information with such Affiliate). If we intend to share your Sensitive
        Personal Information or the Affiliate changes the purpose of using and processing Personal Information, we will
        obtain your authorization and consent to this change.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Typically facial recognition services (such as real person verification, logging in with facial recognition and
      unlocking with facial recognition) are provided by DingTalk&rsquo;s Affiliate in Beijing, Ant Zoloz Technology Co.,
      Ltd under Ant Financial Group (&ldquo;Ant Zoloz&rdquo;). In order to facilitate your use of facial recognition
      services provided by Ant Zoloz in different scenarios and applications and to improve the accuracy and security of
      face recognition, Ant Zoloz will keep your facial feature information in compliance with the Ant Financial Group
      privacy policy. In order to improve the accuracy of real person verification and certification, Ant Zoloz may
      compare your facial feature information with your facial feature information that is connected/controlled by
      authorized organizations and/or government organizations (where necessary). You may stop the facial recognition
      service within DingTalk App, or you may contact us as indicated in Section 8 herein if you have any question.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>7. <u>Sharing with authorized partners</u>: <strong>Certain services of ours will be jointly provided together
          with our authorized partners solely for the purposes stated in this Policy. We may share certain Personal
          Information of yours with our partners to provide better customer service and user experience.</strong> For

        logistics service providers to arrange delivery of such products, or we have to share your personal information
        to arrange with our partner to provide service. We will only share your Personal Information for lawful, proper,
        necessary, specific and explicit purposes to the extent required for providing the services. <strong>Our partners
          have no right to use the shared Personal Information for any other purpose irrelevant with products or
          services.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>DingTalk services contain links to other websites. Except for otherwise stipulated by laws, DingTalk shall not be
      liable in any way for the privacy protection measures of those websites. We may add links to the websites of our
      business partners or shared brands when necessary, and the information provided shall be limited to general
      information and we will not disclose your identity.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>(II) Transfer</strong></li>

        to obtain your authorization and consent again.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>(III) Public disclosure</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will disclose your Personal Information to the public only under the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1. We may disclose your Personal Information to the public with your explicit consent;</li>
      <li>2. <strong>If we determine that you have violated laws and regulations, or have a material breach of the
          agreements with or regulations of DingTalk, or we intend to protect DingTalk&rsquo;s and its Affiliates&rsquo;
          users or the general public from damages to their personal security, we may disclose your Personal Information
          in accordance with laws and regulations, </strong>including the relevant violation and measures taken by
        DingTalk against you<strong>.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>(IV) Exceptions to obtaining prior authorization and consent for sharing, transferring and disclosing
          Personal Information </strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Unless otherwise stated in a country specific addendum, your Personal Information may be shared, transferred or
      disclosed to the public without your authorization and consent under the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1. National safety and national defense security are involved;</li>
      <li>2. Public security, public health, or major public interests are involved;</li>
      <li>3. Criminal investigation, prosecution, judgment and enforcement are involved;</li>
      <li>4. For the purpose of protecting your or other individual&rsquo;s life, property and other major lawful rights
        and interests, where it is hard to obtain your or such individual&rsquo;s prior consent;</li>
      <li>5. The Personal Information is disclosed voluntarily by you to the public;</li>
      <li>6. The Personal Information is collected from the information disclosed through lawful channels, such as lawful
        news reports or information disclosure by government, and is already publicly available</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Pursuant to laws, sharing and transfer of de-identified Personal Information (which cannot be recovered by the
      recipient to re-identify the subjects of such Personal Information) does not constitute a transfer or disclosure of
      Personal Information, and therefore it may be stored and processed without notice to you.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>V. How we protect your Personal Information</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p>We will take various precautions to protect your Personal Information so as to safeguard your Personal Information
      from loss, misappropriation and misuse, and from being accessed, disclosed, modified or destroyed without
      permission. In order to protect the safety of your Personal Information, we have established strict information
      security provisions and procedures, and have a professional information security team to implement the above
      precautions within the company.</p>

      protection of information system (level III).</p>

    </ul>
    <p><u>Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data</u></p>
    <p>Our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Information described above will depend on the Personal
      Information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.</p>
    <p>However, we will normally collect Personal Information from you only (i) where we need the Personal Information to
      perform a contract with you, (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your
      rights, or (iii) where we have your consent to do so. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect
      Personal Information from you or may otherwise need the Personal Information to protect your vital interests or
      those of another person.</p>
    <p>If we ask you to provide Personal Information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you,
      we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Information is
      mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Information).</p>
    <p>If we collect and use your Personal Information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third
      party), this interest will normally be to operate our platform and communicating with you as necessary to provide
      our services to you and for our legitimate commercial interest, for instance, when responding to your queries,
      improving our platform, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities.
      We may have other legitimate interests and, if appropriate, we will make clear to you at the relevant time what
      those legitimate interests are.</p>
    <p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use
      your Personal Information, please contact us using the contact details provided below.</p>
    <p><u>Safeguards for Data Transfers</u></p>
    <p>However, if you are a resident of the EEA, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your Personal
      Information will remain protected in accordance with this Policy. These include implementing the European
      Commission&rsquo;s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of Personal Information between our group companies,
      which require all group companies to protect Personal Information they process from the EEA in accordance with
      European Union data protection law.</p>
    <p><u>Retention Periods</u></p>
    <p>We retain Personal Information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for
      example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting
      requirements).</p>
    <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we will either delete or
      anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been stored in backup
      archives), then we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing until
      deletion is possible.</p>

    <p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area, you have the following data protection rights:</p>
    <ul>

        your Personal Information or request portability of your Personal Information. Again, you can exercise these
        rights by contacting us using the contact details provided below.</li>
      <li>3. You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time. You can exercise this
        right by clicking on the &ldquo;unsubscribe&rdquo; or &ldquo;opt-out&rdquo; link in the marketing e-mails we send
        you. To opt-out of other forms of marketing (such as postal marketing or telemarketing), please contact us using
        the contact details provided below.</li>
      <li>4. Similarly, if we have collected and process your Personal Information with your consent, then you can
        withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we
        conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your Personal Information conducted in
        reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</li>
      <li>5. You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your Personal
        Information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.</li>
